#Setting up an in-class-activity repository#
- Using git bash, `cd` to a directory you will use to put your in class activities.  For example `~/Desktop/bootcamp-code/`.  Now clone the in-class-activities github repository from [https://github.com/KC135Q/in-class-activity](https://github.com/KC135Q/in-class-activity "https://github.com/KC135Q/in-class-activity").
- Once that is complete, `cd` into the `in-class-activity` directory and view the contents (readme.md and some directories)
- In your IDE (Sublime Text 3), open the directory for today's lesson  **HINT -** Open the `in-class-activity` folder (`File -> Open Folder`) to quickly access subsequent in class activity files.  Directory structure is week/day/ so for week 2, day 3 lesson open the `~/Desktop/bootcamp-code/in-class-activity/week2/day3' folder.
**HINT ** Leave git bash and your IDE open for the duration of today's class.

#During class: gittin the exercises
- For each in-class activity, the branch of this repo to use will be Slacked out (Ex; Activity branch: `warmup-bootstrap-component`)
- __Troubleshooting__ if your repo isn't communicating and you can't checkout a branch, you may need to fetch the master to reset it
- To update your local system to see the in-class activity material simply checkout that branch from the repo using git bash (Ex; `git checkout warmup-bootstrap-component`)
- Once you have checked out the new branch, you may need to refresh your IDE display.  To do this in Sublime Text 3, select `Project -> Refresh Folders` You will know because the previous activity folder is still showing in the `FOLDERS` list.
- That is all... Q
